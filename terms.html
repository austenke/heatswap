        <p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE ("AGREEMENT" OR "TERMS OF USE") CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE WEBSITE AND SERVICES OFFERED BY HEATSWAP LLC. ("HEATSWAP). THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE ATc HTTP://WWW.HEATSWAP.COM (THE "SITE") AND ALL SERVICES PROVIDED BY HEATSWAP ON THE SITE. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By using the Site in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the "user" or "you") agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Site, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site.

<b>1. HeatSwap is a venue</b>
<br>
<br>
        HeatSwap acts as a venue to allow users who comply with HeatSwap's policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods within a fixed-price format. HeatSwap is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, HeatSwap has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. HeatSwap does not pre-screen users or the content or information provided by users. HeatSwap cannot guarantee that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Consequently, HeatSwap does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer. 
        <br>
        <br>
        HeatSwap cannot verify the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. HeatSwap encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.
        <br>
        <br> 
        You agree that HeatSwap is a venue and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on HeatSwap. You use the HeatSwap service at your own risk.

        <br>
        <b>3. Fees and Billing</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Joining and setting up a shop on HeatSwap is free. HeatSwap does not charge fees for listing an item for sale. We charge a 7% commission fee only when an item is sold. One percent of the fees we receive from the seller we donate to our non-profit partners. When you list an item you have a chance to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for HeatSwap's services are effective after HeatSwap provides you with at least fourteen (14) days' notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, HeatSwap may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for HeatSwap's services for promotional events (for example, free listing days); such changes are effective when HeatSwap posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. HeatSwap may, at HeatSwap's sole discretion, change some or all of HeatSwap's services at any time. In the event HeatSwap introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD). 
        <br>
        <br>
        In certain situations, including but not limited to a void or invalid transaction, HeatSwap may issue a credit for the applicable fees to a seller's billing statement. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using HeatSwap at the time of the sale or it won’t go through. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Fees and termination:</b> If HeatSwap terminates a listing or your account, if you close your account, or if the payment of your HeatSwap fees cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay HeatSwap for all unpaid fees plus any penalties, if applicable. If the seller's account is not paid in full and becomes past due, the seller risks penalties such as the suspension of privileges and/or termination of the account and other collection mechanisms (including retaining collection agencies and legal counsel). If you have a question or wish to dispute a charge, contact HeatSwap.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>4. Listing and Selling</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Listing description:</b> By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with HeatSwap's published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your HeatSwap shop. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. If the "in stock" quantity is more than one, all items in that listing must be identical. Each unique item must have its own listing. 
        <br>
        <br>
       <b>Shop policies:</b> All sellers are urged to outline shop policies for their HeatSwap shop. These policies may include, for example, shipping, returns, payment and selling policies. Sellers must create reasonable policies in good faith and must abide by such policies. All shop policies must comply with HeatSwap's site-wide policies. Sellers are responsible for enforcing their own reasonable shop policies. HeatSwap reserves the right to request that a seller modify a shop policy. 
       <br>
       <br>
        <b>Binding sale:</b> Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items and buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller's listing (such as payment method), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer's identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.
        <br>
        <br> 
        <b>Fee avoidance:</b> The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may charge reasonable shipping and handling fees to cover the costs for packaging and mailing the items. Sellers may not charge excessive shipping fees or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item's price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding HeatSwap transaction fees, misrepresent the item's location, or use another user's account without permission.
        <br>
        <br>
       <b>5. Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items and Activities</b>
       <br>
       <br>
        You are solely responsible for your conduct and activities on and regarding HeatSwap and any and all data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links (together, "Content") that you submit, post, and display on HeatSwap. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Restricted activities.</b> Your Content and your use of HeatSwap shall not:

        <br>
        <br>
        HeatSwap does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on HeatSwap. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense.

        <br>
        <b>8. Meetings</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        Users may arrange and attend online virtual meetings or in-person meetings ("Meetings") with one or more individuals. Users are solely responsible for interactions with others. Users must comply with HeatSwap's policies and acknowledge and agree to comply with the laws of the city, county and country in which the Meeting occurs. Additional eligibility requirements for a particular group or Meeting may be set by the group's contact person. HeatSwap is not involved with user generated groups, the groups' requirements, or the Meetings. 
        <br>
        <br>
        HeatSwap does not supervise or control the Meetings, user-initiated online or offline gatherings, or the interactions among and between users and other persons or companies. Users are solely responsible for interactions with others. Users understand that HeatSwap does not in any way screen its users. All users agree to exercise caution and good judgment in all interactions with others, particularly if meeting offline or in person. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Groups or user fees:</b> Some user-generated groups on HeatSwap may require or request that users pay fees in order to be a member of the group, participate in a promotion, or participate in Meetings. HeatSwap is not involved in the transactions, the payments or their processing. The payment does not go to HeatSwap. This money is separate from any fees or charges assessed by HeatSwap, and HeatSwap has no control over the money,  the user-generated groups, promotions, meetings, or the leader of the group in connection with its use. You acknowledge and agree that HeatSwap is neither involved nor a party in any payment, transaction, or interaction between or among user-generated groups, HeatSwap users and/or third parties (together a “third party transaction”), and that you bear all risk in connection with your third party transactions. Users should use common sense and be careful in deciding whether to contribute money.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>9. Resolution of Disputes and Release</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        In the event a dispute arises between you and HeatSwap, please contact HeatSwap. Any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be finally settled by arbitration in San Francisco, California, using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under this Agreement shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or state courts located in San Francisco. Use of the Site is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of the Agreement, including without limitation, this section. You and HeatSwap agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Site (including, but not limited to, any services provided or made available therein) or this Agreement must commence within six months after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Disputes with users or third parties:</b> If you have a dispute with a third party or user, HeatSwap encourages you to contact the user or third party to resolve the dispute peacefully. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If a buyer and seller are unable to resolve a dispute resulting from a transaction on HeatSwap, you may also report user-to-user disputes to your local law enforcement, postmaster general, or certified mediation or arbitration entity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Should you have a dispute with one or more users, or an outside party, you release HeatSwap (and HeatSwap's officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

        <br>
        <br>
        HeatSwap reserves the right to suspend and/or terminate a person’s account or any accounts held by that person by virtue of association, including all usernames under which that person operates on HeatSwap.

        <br>
        HeatSwap, Heatswap’s subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and HeatSwap suppliers provide HeatSwap’s Site and services “as is” and without any warranty of condition, express, implied or statutory. HeatSwap, HeatSwap’s subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and HeatSwap’s suppliers specifically disclaim any implied warranties of title, merchantability, performance, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. In addition, no advice or information (oral or written) obtained by you from HeatSwap shall create any warranty. Some states do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties so the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you. This warranty gives you specific legal rights and you may also have other legal rights that vary from state to state. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>15. Liability Limit</b>

        In no event shall HeatSwap and HeatSwap’s subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees or suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, general, special compensatory, consequential and/or incidental, arising out of or relating to the conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the use of HeatSwap’s site, services, or this agreement, including without limitation lost profits, bodily injury, emotional distress or any special, incidental, or consequential damages. 
        <br>
        <br>
        HeatSwap’s liability and (as applicable) the liability of HeatSwap’s subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, and suppliers, to you or any third parties in any circumstance is limited to the greater of (a) the amount of fees you pay to HeatSwap in the amount of fees you pay to HeatSwap in the 12 months prior to the action giving rise to liability and (b) $100. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>16. Indemnity</b>
        <br>
        <br>
